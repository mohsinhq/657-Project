# Basic World Project
# Description

# This is a simple 3D world featuring a house and some trees. I've implemented basic player controls to move around and explore the environment.
# Features

#     WASD Controls: Move the player forward, backward, left, and right.
#     Camera Controls: Use the mouse for left and right camera movement.
#     Sprint: Hold Shift to sprint.
#     Jump: Press Space to jump.

# NOTE you need to manually change the walk and sprint speed on the  players inspector, (5 for walk, 10 for sprint), and on main camera (50 for rotation speed)
